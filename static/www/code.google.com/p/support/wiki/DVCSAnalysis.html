 </div>
 <h1><a name="Analysis_of_Git_and_Mercurial"/>Analysis of Git and Mercurial</h1><p><i>Note: this analysis was done in summer 2008, when we first began scoping work for DVCS support in Google Code.</i> </p><h2><a name="Introduction"/>Introduction</h2><p>This document summarizes the initial research for adding distributed version control as an option for Google Code. Based on popularity, two distributed version control systems were considered: Git and Mercurial. This document describes the features of the two systems, and provides an overview of the work required to integrate them with Google Code. </p><h2><a name="Distributed_Version_Control"/>Distributed Version Control</h2><p>In traditional version control systems, there is a central repository that maintains all history. Clients must interact with this repository to examine file history, look at other branches, or commit changes. Typically, clients have a local copy of the versions of files they are working on, but no local storage of previous versions or alternate branches. </p><p>Distributed Version Control Systems (DVCS) use a different structure. With DVCS, every user has their own local repository, complete with project history, branches, etc. Switching to an alternate branch, examining file history, and even committing changes are all local operations. Individual repositories can then exchange information via push and pull operations. A push transfers some local information to a remote repository, and a pull copies remote information to the local repository. Note that neither repository is necessarily &quot;authoritative&quot; with respect to the other. Both repositories may have some local history that the other does not have yet. One key feature of any DVCS system is to make it easy for repositories to unambiguously describe the history they have (and the history they are requesting). Both Git and Mercurial do this by using SHA1 hashes to identify data (files, trees, changesets, etc). </p><p>DVCS&#x27;s provide a lot of flexibility in developer workflows. They can be used in a manner similar to traditional VCS&#x27;s, with a central &quot;authoritative&quot; repository with which each developer synchronizes. For larger projects, it is also possible to have a hierarchy of server repositories, with maintainers for each repository accepting changes from downstream developers and then forwarding them upstream. DVCS&#x27;s also allow developers to share work with each other directly. For example, two developers working on a new feature could work on a common branch and share work with each other independent of an &quot;authoritative&quot; server. Once their work was stable, it could then be pushed to a public repository for a larger audience. </p><p>Because there is no central repository, the terms client and server don&#x27;t necessarily apply. When talking about two repositories, they are typically referred to as local and remote rather than client and server. However, in the context of implementing a DVCS for Google Code, the repository hosted at Google will be considered the server, and a user&#x27;s repository will be called the client. </p><h2><a name="Feature_Comparison"/>Feature Comparison</h2><p>There is actually a great deal of similarity between Git and Mercurial. Instead of providing a long list of features that are equivalently supported in both system, this section attempts to highlight areas of significant difference between the systems. </p><h3><a name="Git_Advantages"/>Git Advantages</h3><ul><li>Client Storage Management. Both Mercurial and Git allow users to selectively pull branches from other repositories. This provides an upfront mechanism for narrowing the amount of history stored locally. In addition, Git allows previously pulled branches to be discarded. Git also allows old revision data to be pruned from the local repository (while still keeping recent revision data on those branches). With Mercurial, if a branch is in the local repository, then all of its revisions (back to the very initial commit) must also be present, and there is no way to prune branches other than by creating a new repository and selectively pulling branches into it. There has been some work addressing this in Mercurial, but nothing official yet. </li></ul><ul><li>Number of Parents. Git supports an unlimited number of parent revisions during a merge. Mercurial only allows two parents. In order to achieve an N-way merge in Mercurial, the user will have to perform N-1 two-way merges. Although in many cases this is also the preferred way to merge N parents regardless of DVCS, with Git the user can perform an N-way merge in one step if so desired. </li></ul><ul><li>Rebasing. Git has a rebase command which allows you to take a local branch and change its branch point to a more recent revision. For example, if one is working on a new feature for a product, a local branch may have been started from the 1.0 release. If while still working on the feature the main product line has been updated to 1.1, it may be desirable to pull in the 1.0-&gt;1.1 changes onto the local feature branch and treat it as a branch from 1.1 instead of 1.0. In most other systems, this is done by merging the 1.1 changes onto the branch. Merging is the right thing to do from an SCM perspective, where the focus is on &#x27;reproducibility of past states&#x27;. However, when the focus is &#x27;authoring a clean software revision history&#x27;, rebasing is sometimes a superior method. git-rebase allows you to make a previously non-linear history linear, keeping the history cleaner. To be fair, the same deltas are produced by simply merging every commit from the 1.0 version to the 1.1 version individually, and committing them individually. Rebasing is about safely doing this and then deleting the old 1.0 based versions so they don&#x27;t clutter the tree.  </li></ul><p><i>Note: Mercurial has added <a href="http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/wiki/index.cgi/RebaseProject" rel="nofollow">rebase support</a> since this analysis was conducted.</i> </p><h3><a name="Mercurial_Advantages"/>Mercurial Advantages</h3><ul><li>Learning Curve. Git has a steeper learning curve than Mercurial due to a number of factors. Git has more commands and options, the volume of which can be intimidating to new users. Mercurial&#x27;s documentation tends to be more complete and easier for novices to read. Mercurial&#x27;s terminology and commands are also a closer to Subversion and CVS, making it familiar to people migrating from those systems. </li></ul><ul><li>Windows Support. Git has a strong Linux heritage, and the official way to run it under Windows is to use cygwin, which is far from ideal from the perspective of a Windows user. A MinGw based port of Git is gaining popularity, but Windows still remains a &quot;second class citizen&quot; in the world of Git. Based on limited testing, the MinGW port appeared to be completely functional, but a little sluggish. Operations that normally felt instantaneous on Linux or Mac OS X took several tenths of a second on Windows. Mercurial is Python based, and the official distribution runs cleanly under Windows (as well as Linux, Mac OS X, etc). </li></ul><ul><li>Maintenance. Git requires periodic maintenance of repositories (i.e. git-gc), Mercurial does not require such maintenance. Note, however, that Mercurial is also a lot less sophisticated with respect to managing the clients disk space (see Client Storage Management above). </li></ul><ul><li>History is Sacred. Git is extremely powerful, and will do almost anything you ask it to. Unfortunately, this also means that Git is perfectly happy to lose history. For example, git-push --force can result in revisions becoming lost in the remote repository. Mercurial&#x27;s repository is structured more as an ever-growing collection of immutable objects. Although in some cases (such as rebase), rewriting history can be an advantage, it can also be dangerous and lead to unexpected results. It should be noted, however, that a custom Git server could be written to disallow the loss of data, so this advantage is minimal. </li></ul><h3><a name="Other_Differences"/>Other Differences</h3><ul><li>Rename/Copy Tracking. Git does not explicitly track file renaming or copying. Instead, commands such as git-log look for cases where an identical file appears earlier in the repository history and infers the rename or copy. Mercurial takes the more familiar approach of providing explicit rename and copy commands and storing this as part of the history of a file. Each approach has both advantages and disadvantages, and it isn&#x27;t clear that either approach is universally &quot;better&quot; than the other. </li></ul><ul><li>Architecture. Git was originally a large number of shell scripts and unix commands implemented in C. Over time, a common library that shared between commands has been developed, and many of the commands have been built into the main git executable. Mercurial is implemented mostly in Python (with a small amount of C), with an extension API that allows third parties to enhance Mercurial via custom Python modules. </li></ul><ul><li>Private History. In Git, the default mode of operation is for developers to have their own local (and private) tags/branches/revisions, and exercise a lot of control over what becomes public. With Mercurial the emphasis is the other way around - default push/pull behavior shares all information and extra steps need to be taken to share a subset. This is not listed as an advantage for either system, because both systems are generally capable of supporting either kind of operation. </li></ul><ul><li>Branch Namespace. In Git, each repository has its own branch namespace, and users set up a mapping between local branchnames and remote ones. With Mercurial, there is a single branch namespace shared by all repositories. </li></ul><h2><a name="Implementation"/>Implementation</h2><h3><a name="Data_Storage"/>Data Storage</h3><p>Both Git and Mercurial internally work with very similar data: revisions of files along with a small amount of meta information (parents, author, etc). They both have objects that represent a project-wide commit, and these are also versioned. They both have objects that associate a commit with a set of file versions. In Git, this is a tree object (a tree structure with tree objects for directories and references to file revisions as the leaves). In Mercurial, there is a manifest (a flat list mapping pathnames to file revision objects). Aside from the manifest/tree difference, both are very similar in terms of how objects are searched and walked. </p><p>Git uses a combination of storing objects directly in the file system (indexed by SHA1 hash) and packing multiple objects into larger compressed files, while Mercurial uses a revlog structure (basically a concatenation of revision diffs with periodic snapshots of a complete revision). In both cases, the native storage will not be used and the objects will be stored in <a href="http://labs.google.com/papers/bigtable-osdi06.pdf" rel="nofollow">Bigtable</a> instead. Due to the similarity of the basic Git and Mercurial data objects, the effort to solve such problems should be the same regardless of which DVCS is being used. </p><p>The only major difference for the data storage layer is the implementation language. If a significant amount of Git/Mercurial code is to be reused, then a Git implementation would be in C, and a Mercurial one would be in Python (or perhaps C++ with SWIG bindings). </p><h3><a name="Mercurial_Integration"/>Mercurial Integration</h3><p>Mercurial has very good support for HTTP based stateless pushing and pulling of remote repositories. A reasonable amount of effort has been made to reduce the number of round trips between client and server in determining what data needs to be exchanged, and once this determination has been made all of the relevant information is bundled into a single large transfer. This is a good match for Google&#x27;s infrastructure, so no modifications will be required on the client side. </p><h3><a name="Git_Integration"/>Git Integration</h3><p>Git includes support for HTTP pulls (and <tt>WebDAV</tt> pushes), but the implementation assumes that the server knows nothing about Git. It is designed such that you can have a Apache simply serve the Git repository as static content. This method requires numerous synchronous round trip requests, and is unsuitable for use in Google Code <sup><b>(1)</b></sup>.  </p><p>Git also has a custom stateful protocol that supports much faster exchanges of information, but this is not a good match for Google infrastructure. Specifically, it is very desirable to use a stateless HTTP protocol since there is already significant infrastructure in place to make such transactions reliable and performant.  </p><p><i>Note: There has been some <a href="http://kerneltrap.org/mailarchive/git/2008/8/3/2795094/thread" rel="nofollow">discussion</a> about improving HTTP support in the Git community since this analysis was done.</i> </p><h2><a name="Summary"/>Summary</h2><p>In terms of implementation effort, Mercurial has a clear advantage due to its efficient HTTP transport protocol. </p><p>In terms of features, Git is more powerful, but this tends to be offset by it being more complicated to use.  </p><hr/><p><sup><b>1</b></sup> As a benchmark, Git and Mercurial repositories were seeded with approximately 1500 files totaling 35 M of data. The servers were running in Chicago and the clients in Mountain View (51 ms ping time). The operation of cloning the remote repository (similar to a initial checkout in traditional version control systems) averaged 8.1 seconds for Mercurial and 178 seconds for Git (22 times slower). A single file in the repository was then changed 50 times and the clients pulled the updates. In this case, Mercurial took 1.5 seconds and Git required 18 seconds (12 times slower). When the Git protocol was used instead of HTTP, Git&#x27;s performance was similar to Mercurial (8.7 seconds for cloning, 2.8 seconds for the pull). </p>

<p>The benchmark sounds better for Mercurial in terms of HTTP transmission an performance, but the adventaje of using a DVCS is exactly the oposite: to do less commits to the &quot;central&quot; repository, and work offline most of the time, I think that it would be a good idea to post similar tests but on local operations (branching, reverting patchs, etc). </p><p>The big adventaje, and the one I think makes Mercurial a better choice, is the support in platforms as Windows using GUI tools like Tortoise Hg. </p>

<p>@carl, I don&#x27;t know about reasonable analysis, but I can&#x27;t argue with the result.   </p><p>Git is far easier than SVN or CVS, especially when creating repositories. How hard is push, pull, merge, branch, checkout, and clone?  I would also say that namespacing is a huge win for Git.  I&#x27;ve always disliked SVN defaulting to putting all projects into one repository.  It just seems dirty. </p><p>The issue with Windows support is valid.  I&#x27;m not happy with either Cygwin or Msysgit&#x27;s reliability. </p><p>Regardless, Hg is a perfectly acceptable choice and doesn&#x27;t really need justification.  Google is primarily a Java/Python company.  Hg is Python. Ergo, Hg is the proper DVCS for Google. </p>

<p>We can guess Google didn&#x27;t consider Bazaar because a project hosting service already exists with Bazaar support: it&#x27;s Launchpad. Personally, I&#x27;m really happy with Mercurial, and it&#x27;s a good news that Google Code now supports a DVCS. </p>

<p>Using this line of thinking, hosting a svn hosting service would also not be necessary as we have Sourceforge - which, by the way, now supports cvs/subversion/bazaar/git/mercurial. </p>

<p>@casey.mcginty - It&#x27;s a bit off topic for this article, but Hg does not have a &#x27;staging area&#x27; concept analogous to Git&#x27;s index. To start tracking a new file, you need to <tt>hg add</tt> it. If you modify a tracked file, it will be part of the next commit if you aren&#x27;t explicit about omitting it. It&#x27;s an easy transition from SVN in this way, <i>but</i> hg is generally a little more flexible when you want it to be. </p><p>For functionality like <tt>git add --interactive</tt>, see the Darcs-inspired <a href="http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/wiki/index.cgi/RecordExtension" rel="nofollow">Record extension</a> for hg, which is included in the official distribution, but needs to be enabled in config. I do wish you could split hunks with it like <tt>git add -i</tt> can, but it&#x27;s still pretty nice. Of course there are also graphical tools that allow you to select changes to commit. </p>

<p>The fourth Mercurial advantage is completely wrong. </p><p>&quot;Unfortunately, this also means that Git is perfectly happy to lose history.&quot; </p><p>No, git goes to great lengths to not lose history.

<p>A couple of corrections to the discussion of git from a longtime user (on a largish project with multiple users using a central repos, which I administer): </p><p>Re. &#x27;git push&#x27; and deletion of data from the remote repos: there is no need for a &#x27;custom server&#x27;; git has a built-in repository option to disable this (even with &#x27;push --force&#x27;): set config property receive.denyNonFastforwards to false on the repos being pushed to; this is actually set by default on bare repositories (the usual setup for central shared ones). There is also a hook script in the git distribution to disallow other kinds of deletes by pushing: the &#x27;update&#x27; hook; you can set hooks.allowdeletebranch, hooks.allowdeletetag, etc. </p><p>Re. maintenance / git-gc: it is not usually necessary to run this manually on a local repository just for performance: various commands will do it automatically for you as needed. You only need to run &#x27;gc --prune&#x27; if you want to delete data that is no longer reachable, e.g. old versions of rebased or deleted branches. This ties in with the &#x27;losing data&#x27; point: it will never do a &#x27;prune&#x27; unless you explicitly tell it to. </p>

<p>Whenever people start talking about how mercurial is easier to use on Windows than git, autocrlf conversion comes to my mind. I admit that last time I checked it was maybe half a year ago, but compared to git&#x27;s it was almost non-existant (seriously, checking for nul character is enough to tell if file is binary or not?!), and buggy, as those conversions didn&#x27;t always fire and I&#x27;d be looking at a diff as if my entire file has changed (and things like that). In git I didn&#x27;t experience such problems, and git has excellent .gitattributes file, where I can specify which files are what, exactly. </p><p>Again, a half or a whole year is a long time for things to have changed, but somehow I doubt crlf situation is any better these days... </p>

<p>What was the badwidth of link used in clone/pull benchmark? DVCS might save bandwidth by sending only difference (only update) at the cost of extra exchange about what client have (versus what server have). </p><p>How were benchmarking done: are the times given in footnote wall time, or user+sys time? Are there more detailed results of this benchmark? </p>

<p>I am happy to see this analysis, and decision.  I am not surprised that it pushes a few &quot;dvcs wars&quot; buttons (everyone has a favorite; eveyrone has their uses; all things change - heck, I remember when RCS was hot!;-) </p><p>I&#x27;m glad to see the migration, and see it incrementally (some have point out &quot;why not all of them?&quot; - sure, just not all at once, plese ;-). </p><p>As for private use, Google Android developers use (nay, develop!) git - so don&#x27;t think that Google is somehow &quot;favoring&quot; one over another. The point here is, for public deployment and use, what is a better bet. </p><p>Even though the use cases are different, you might find the discussion on the same choices being made in the Python repositories at <a href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0374/" rel="nofollow">http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0374/</a> and the decision for the Python repository to move to hg at pep-0385. </p><p>I for one use all 3.   For open source projects, I am curious when hg will be available on code.google.com, as starting people on &quot;remote sprinting&quot; will be useful, and ANY DVCS will help.  NOTE (for those moving or mirroring from SVN to hg) SVN and bzr version empty<a href="/p/support/w/edit/empty">?</a> directories; hg and git (and cvs) do not. </p>

<p>We live in a world of convention over configuration. Everybody knows that <strong>insert favourite dvcs here</strong> can be configured to any of the things that attracted Google to Mercurial. But at the end of the day Mercurials standard conventions were closest to what Google was looking for. </p>

<p>I hope googlecode support git.  Why?  &quot;git on windows&quot; is no problem, cygwin/msysgit+tortoisegit. More? easy,popular,powerful. googlecode+github is bad idea. </p>

<p>Actually I have been using git for quite a while and I agree here with googles choice for other reasons. </p><p>Some things I git are outright dangerous and even users who have been using git for some time might fall over it. </p><p>Here is an example, everyone and even the semi official git book on the net says that reverting like in SVN should be done with git reset --hard, while this is somewhat true but the git reset operation alters history which is a bigger problem once you have pushed your changes (and the next user pulling your data in or you yourself having to fight with the revlog if you have done an accidental reset will agree)! </p><p>Better checkout, but then if you checkout the wrong way (by forgetting a file or directory directive) you will automatically get a floating head and users suddenly will start to hack into the floating head. Git simply makes assumptions without telling you and the only way to find out is by rechecking out the master or finding the line in the man page describing it! </p><p>As for now I dont see any reasons to switch from git, but for a joined team development effort I would think twice of introducing it. First the cygwin port is simply not up to par to the other versions neither is msysgit which also just is a cygwin like layer which does not help the stability nor the performance (I cannot understand why everyone raves about msys which is as native as cygwin). </p><p>Secondly git provides a lot of flexibility but all this comes with a price. Now the average development team has several good experienced people a higher number of mediocre ones and a small number of bad ones, how do you deal with the dangerous operations git provides without any limitation to their access or warnings? You have to resolve that on project level while hg pushes you onto tracks. </p><p>As I said I am used to git, and will not change since hg does not really provide anthing worth switching over to me(and face it git-svn while having bugs is a huge plus especially if you are stuck with svn servers and want to sync them into your local repo), but I dont think it is that easy and painless to use like some videos on the net seem to indicate ;-) What you really have to to is to limit yourself to behavior which definitely does not alter anything in the history, so to say the subset of commands and behaviors hg enforces and you have to enforce that in your project, but on the other hand then you could use hg which does the enforcement for you. On the other hand the lack of lightweight branches in the core of hg is annoying as hell, sure there is a plugin, but this feature needs to be in the core :-( </p>

<p>&gt; why don&#x27;t you know &#x27;git revert&#x27;? why don&#x27;t you create develop branch and working in it? </p><p>Git revert is not the same as svn revert, git revert kills the last checkin or the checkin you give it as parameter. If you do that you definitely do not get a revert but instead you have killed your last commit as well! </p><p>This is one of the biggest mistakes people make coming from svn assuming git revert is the same as svn revert while it is not! </p><p>The main problem I have with the documentation is that git reset hard should resemble svn revert while it clearly does not and introduces a dangerous operation. Git checkout -f HEAD . clearly is the equivalent and does not fiddle around with the history, this is funnily also the same how HG handles reverts in a save manner. There was a time when reset --hard HEAD was the recommended way until people started to shoot themselves into the foot with it, literally. </p><p>&gt;1. Thinking that, &#x27;why linux kernel used it&#x27;. 2. To design a workflow for team. 3. If you true, the git is a bad tool, not used it. </p><p>That is the main problem with git, git is very centered around the workflow of the linux people and basically evolved from a mess of low level tools into something which can be used (with pitfalls) while mercurial tries to enforce certain rails which prevent desaster. It still is a mess with a recommended way, and that is the reason why I currently would not use it within a team centric environment and why I have less problem with mercurial. On the other hand I can see its power and I have learned it so I have no problem to use it myself and prefer it over HG for personal use. </p>

<p>Actually user interface the problems are known, to the git people, no need to contact the mailinglist. I btw. found another git porcellain project which cleans up most if not all of the problems <a href="http://www.gnome.org/~newren/eg/" rel="nofollow">http://www.gnome.org/~newren/eg/</a> so far from what I have seen I like, it is how the commands from git should be. </p>
