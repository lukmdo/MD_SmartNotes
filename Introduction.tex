Creating a network applications in nowadays might be a complicated process of design which involves long series of research and experiments or be a fairly simple procedure that does take only tenth of it time and effort. In both cases the frequent evaluation metric is the application scalability more than thousands line of code or model complexity. With time gained popularity network  applications usage arises what in consequence implies increase in frequency that application is requested to serve its functionality. This growth can be calculated and included at the is planing level becoming a good programming practice that places itself close to other already widely approved design patterns. With no doubt scalability is staring to play a more and more important role being often set at the same level with such issues like portability or security[quote]. I was looking for idea for an application that by its original functionality would heave the potential to become with time a really heavy traffic network application with lots of active users.
