My application named SmartNotes is mend as a tool helping to keep our notes always actual and ready to use. Disregarding whether we fly by plane, work in the office, use different machines with different operating systems, or just only occasionally are connect to Internet our notes will stay synchronized in all the places we may want to always with the latest available version. Its key features are availability and scalability that combine the power of Google infrastructure with Mercurial a popular Version Control System.
