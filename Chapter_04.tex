This chapter covers the system design related with the the specific solutions that were chosen for the SmartNotes application realization. The system concept which was introduced in chapter~\ref{chap:concept} will become extended by describing some of the implementation elements and problems found during the development process. This should allow the reader have a deeper view into the SmartNotes application including functions that it offers and platform that it runs on.
\section{Google App Engine platform}\label{sec:gae}
Google App Engine is a great development platform. For all the reasons mentioned in~\ref{sec:gae_general} it was decided to give it a try before any other hosting services. Besides it does seam to be highly competitive when it comes to cost calculations which are done in section~\ref{subsec:gae_calculations}.
After registering an application it can be straight forward uploaded to Google and after a couple of seconds accessed to its users.
