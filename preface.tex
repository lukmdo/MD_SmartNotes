The goal of my project was to create a network application written in Python programming language that would face the problem of scalability. After deciding for specific application functionality I focused implementation. My choice was Google App Engine platform which was both challenging and rewarding experience. Combining it with the most popular Version Control system in the Python world I had a recipe for an application that would allow for managing personal notes with synchronization as a key feature. By creating a functional yet easy to use interface using Cacoa and PyObjective-C I exposed the application functionality to the end user.  

The work is divided in XX chapters. In the XX chapter I am described elements used  in my project with comparison of highly popular solutions. The XX chapter I addressed the term of scalability where I explained it meaning   and role of nowadays network applications. Next in chapter XX . Final chapter contains an evaluation of my work with some performance,  traffic load tests.
